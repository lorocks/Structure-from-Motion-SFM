# Structure from Motion (SFM)

An implementation of a Structure from Motion (SFM) pipeline for 3D reconstruction based on the paper *Building Rome in a Day* ([linked here](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/rome/rome_paper.pdf)). Obtained results from running this pipeline on an Nvidia Jeston Orin Nano are compated against point-cloud information gathered using a ZED stereo camera.
